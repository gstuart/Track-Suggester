              Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. Java has a strong presence among large enterprise applications—think bank, hospital, and university software. It is a good choice for those inclined toward mobile development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Java is considered as the perfect language for the developers and programmers to learn. Currently it is the top-most programming language and has grabbed the highest position with Android OS yet again, though it was a bit down a few years ago. Java can be utilized for mobile-based applications, enterprise level purpose, for creating desktop applications, and for establishing Android apps on tablets and smartphones.

            <!-- section describing C# -->
            <p>
              Pronounced "C-sharp," C# is a multi-paradigm language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. Combining principles from C and C++, C# is a general-purpose language used to develop software for Microsoft and Windows platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              C# belongs to the Microsoft’s family of programming language and was developed in 2000 to be the part of the first ever release of Microsoft’s prestigious .NET framework. C# is very similar to Java in terms of capabilities. It has been said that C# combines the robustness of C++ with the advanced features of Java. Therefore, if you are good at Java, it is extremely easy to switch to C# and vice-versa. The importance of the usage of C# in Microsoft’s application, this is the course for you if you are looking to develop applications for Windows-based platforms. The job market for C# programmers is also good and you can find a lucrative job being a C# programmer.
            <p>
              C# language is used to develop almost all types of software applications that come with Visual Studio IDE. You can develop a dynamic web based application in ASP.NET, but will be required to code in C# or Visual Basic to write backend handling mechanism. You can use C# to develop a Windows form application or a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Application. Similarly, if you want to develop a Windows phone application, again this is the course for you.

            Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. Java has a strong presence among large enterprise applications—think bank, hospital, and university software. It is a good choice for those inclined toward mobile development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java is considered as the perfect language for the developers and programmers to learn. Currently it is the top-most programming language and has grabbed the highest position with Android OS yet again, though it was a bit down a few years ago. Java can be utilized for mobile-based applications, enterprise level purpose, for creating desktop applications, and for establishing Android apps on tablets and smartphones.
